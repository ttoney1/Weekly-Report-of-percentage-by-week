# Weekly-Report-of-percentage-by-week
R codes to to create visualizations of percentage of subjects by week

R codes you created for the CDC weekly report that reads the raw data files (you will need to save the raw data files into a raw data folder to run the codes). Each code automatically exports a different choropleth map. There is a map for the below:

1. COVID death percentages by state
2. COVID hospital admission rates per 100k by county (HSA level – each county in the same HSA gets same color code since not all counties have hospitals, but all HSA’s have hospitals. A couple HAS’s that did not have hospitals were simply re-aligned to nearby HAS’s that have hospitals. By the way, an HSA (Health Service Area) is a group of counties in the same area that can all use the same hospitals.
3. ED (percentage of COVID Emergency Department visits among all Emergency department visits) by state
4. COVID percentage of positive test results by HHS region (in this map, all state belonging to the same HHS region get the same color code).
